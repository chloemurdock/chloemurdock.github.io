Stories set facts on fire. I light up authors’ stories as a developmental editor. And as a digital marketing consultant, I light up the personal brands of authors and other small business owners so more people can find their stories online.

I provide:

Developmental editing of manuscripts prior to submitting to a publisher

Digital marketing services for authors’ personal brands and other small business owners that match my mission

This site is my virtual portfolio. Explore my resume and past work to see what I am capable of.

I’ve got an eye for editing and strategic communication. And I’m a writer myself, with a background in journalism. I’ve reported on state legal news at Missouri Lawyers Media; how survivors marked the anniversary of a mass shooting, human trafficking myths and more at 91.3 WYSO; interfaith lectures at the Chautauqua Institution and on a split mining complex in the Republic of Kosovo.

I have been a copywriter for an author’s personal brand, ghostwriting in this author’s voice for search-engine-optimized blog and social media posts. I also researched guests for this author’s podcast, prepared questions in advance of podcast interviews, transcribed those interviews and plucked out soundbites for audiogram social media posts.

Through Miami University’s Writing Scholars Program and editing The Miami Student Magazine, a longform creative nonfiction publication, I sharpened my digital red pen for editing, which translates well for fiction and nonfiction authors alike.

I’m also trained to research digital audits, which lays out strengths and pain points of a brand or company’s digital presence. Aided by this market research, I can create strategic communication proposals that outline solutions to improve the digital presence of someone’s company or personal brand.

I have a past life in global marketing at ABB Inc., where I first honed my digital marketing skills. Here, I also wrote and edited promotional videos, educational brochures, technical writing manuals, case studies and press releases that translated complex engineering, automation and artificial intelligence concepts for salespeople. This translates well for authors and creators of educational materials and textbooks.
