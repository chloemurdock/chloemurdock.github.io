I'm an intern as well as a college student who is studying journalism and international studies. Whether I'm writing a news article, a feature story, a press release or a script, I set out to turn complicated topics into stories anyone can read. I can complete any assignment, but I especially love my job when I write stories that make people think, act, feel or do all three.

This site is my virtual portfolio. Explore my resume and past work to see what I am capable of.
