I’m a May 2021 graduate from Miami University with degrees in journalism and international studies, with a concentration in global cultural relations. 
 
Whether I’m writing a news article, a feature story, a press release, social media copy or a podcast script, I set out to turn complicated topics into stories anyone can read. I can complete any assignment, but I especially love my job when I write stories that make people think, act, feel or do all three.
 
This site is my virtual portfolio. Explore my resume and past work to see what I am capable of.
