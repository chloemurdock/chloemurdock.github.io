I hope FAFSA comes

In clutch or imma strip to

Pay off college debt.

...

Senior year is meant

To be fun? Tell that to all

Of my AP classes.

...

Last tests taken, last

Deadlines made, last goodbyes said

As last days pass by.

...

The senior deadlines

Are killing graduation

Vibes these last few months.

...

Senioritis KILLSâ€¦

GPAs for the sake of

Winning the shootout.

...

Last days will soon be

Distant memories for our

2016 class.
