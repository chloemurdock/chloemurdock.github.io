## ABB upgrades cement manufacturer’s ABB Knowledge Manager and Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)

Westerville, OHIO, USA—Monarch Cement awarded ABB a contract to upgrade their ABB Knowledge Manager and extend their ABB LIMS at Monarch’s Humboldt, Kansas, USA site.



Monarch will receive the latest version of ABB Knowledge Manager, which is updated with ABB AbilityTM System 800xA integration, increased reporting capability and improved user interface. The updated LIMS will run under one common operator interface for ease of data sharing, and also enable comprehensive data mining.

ABB’s Knowledge Manager provides solutions and advanced tools to facilitate the collection, consolidation and distribution of production, quality and energy information via the plant’s web-based reports, trends, and graphs.
